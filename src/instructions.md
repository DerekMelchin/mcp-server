For Python projects, write code in PEP8 style (snake_case) or convert the code using the PEP8 Converter Tool (`update_code_to_pep8`).

Before running backtests, run the compile tool (`create_compile` and `read_compile`) to get the syntax errors and then fix them.

Where more efficient, use the `patch_file` tool to only update the lines of code with errors instead of using the `update_file_contents` tool.
