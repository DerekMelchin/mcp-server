To create a new project, call the `create_project` tool instead of trying to create the project files on the local machine.

The project Id is in the config file, under `cloud-id`. Don't call the `list_backtests` tool unless it's absolutely needed.

For Python projects, write code in PEP8 style (snake_case) or convert the code using the PEP8 Converter Tool (`update_code_to_pep8`).

When creating indicator objects (such as RSI, SMA, etc.), never overwrite the indicator method names (e.g., do not assign to `self.rsi`, `self.sma`, etc.). Instead, use a different variable name, preferably with a leading underscore for non-public instance variables (e.g., `self._rsi = self.rsi(self._symbol, 14))`. This prevents conflicts with the built-in indicator methods and ensures code reliability.

ALWAYS choose variable names different from the methods you're calling.

Before running backtests, run the compile tool (`create_compile` and `read_compile`) to get the syntax errors and then FIX ALL COMPILE WARNINGS.

Where more efficient, use the `patch_file` tool to only update the lines of code with errors instead of using the `update_file_contents` tool.
